# Encoders_Explained

Understand the transformer architecture by learning about encoders with detailed explanations on the architecture and a mini-project

# How to use

This repository is not made to use the code inside in itself, but as a summary of differents classes and papers you can find on the internet. It is a complete guide to understand the basics, but in details, of how encoders within the Transformer architecture work and how they can be used as a standalone architecture for certain tasks. 

You will find:

1. A explanations.ipynb notebook in which you will find all the information about encoders and their code implementation.

2. A Mini-project folder in which you will find a code and a cleaner code for the implemenation of the encoder which can be called directly like a library
